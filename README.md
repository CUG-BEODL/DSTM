## Dataset Introduction

This paper introduces the Daily 0.1Â° high-resolution XCO2 dataset for China from 2015 to 2020. This dataset provides daily, high-resolution (0.1Â° spatial resolution) XCO2 data for China, generated using a deep learning-based spatio-temporal fusion model (DSTM). The model integrates multiple data sources, including satellite observations from OCO-2 and CarbonTracker, as well as data on atmospheric transport, carbon emissions, and carbon sinks. This dataset offers comprehensive and continuous XCO2 data coverage across China, facilitating detailed analyses of carbon cycle dynamics and supporting policy adjustments for carbon neutrality.

### **Dataset Access**

You can access and download the dataset from the Science Data Bank using the following link:

## Usage

### Perpare
- **Python environment**  
You need to install the following libraries: *pytorch, gdal, numpy, pandas, sklearn, scipy*.
```bash
conda create -n DSTM python=3.9

# Recommend installing according to the official PyTorch method.(Don't use the following)
conda install pytorch=1.13

conda install gdal=3.3.3
```

- **Training data**  
  To generate the required training files, use the *ExtractMultiValuesToPoints.py* script located in the tool folder (a shapefile of the Chinese region and multi-source TIFF files are required). Subsequently, calculate the mean and standard deviation of the resulting .npy files and provide these statistics to *dataset.py* for data normalization. Finally, train the model using the *trainPatch.py* script and perform predictions and validation with the *predict.py* script.
