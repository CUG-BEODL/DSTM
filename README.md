## Usage
### Perpare
- **Python environment**  
You need to install the following libraries: *pytorch, gdal, numpy, pandas, sklearn, scipy*.
```bash
conda create -n DSTM python=3.9

# Recommend installing according to the official PyTorch method.(Don't use the following)
conda install pytorch=1.13

conda install gdal=3.3.3
```

- **Training data**  
  To generate the required training files, use the *ExtractMultiValuesToPoints.py* script located in the tool folder (a shapefile of the Chinese region and multi-source TIFF files are required). Subsequently, calculate the mean and standard deviation of the resulting .npy files and provide these statistics to *dataset.py* for data normalization. Finally, train the model using the *trainPatch.py* script and perform predictions and validation with the *predict.py* script.
